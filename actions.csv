The work required isolations, drain ‑ down, verification of zero ‑ energy, and confirmation that all personnel were clear before opening the system. While preparing for the final verification, one operator left the immediate area to search for a missing hose clamp without informing the lead technician. When the team began the pre ‑ entry headcount before breaking containment, one worker could not be located. Radio calls went unanswered due to the worker having set the radio on a nearby cart while checking equipment. Concerned that the operator may have re ‑ entered the barricaded zone or approached the system while residual pressure remained, the team initiated the missing ‑ person protocol and halted isolations. The operator was later found in an adjacent storage area retrieving hardware. No exposure or system breach occurred, but the temporary uncertainty stopped all work and triggered emergency standby. What could have happened Worker could have encountered residual chemical vapors from incomplete isolation. Potential for line movement or unexpected pressure release during flush. Unauthorized proximity to the transfer manifold could have resulted in splashes or inhalation exposure. Crew might have initiated containment opening without full accountability. Why did it happen – Root causes Inadequate location ‑ tracking process for tasks requiring staged isolation and verification. Communication system not designed for mandatory radio carriage during chemical ‑ handling operations. Insufficient integration of personnel ‑ accountability steps into the flush procedure. Causal factors Worker left the zone during a critical step without performing required verbal check ‑ out. High noise levels reduced ability to hear verbal calls. Time pressure to complete line flush before turnaround activities. Poor visibility around the manifold due to portable barriers and equipment congestion. Radio charging setup encouraged operators to remove devices rather than swap batteries. What went well Crew initiated a stop ‑ work immediately after failed headcount. Barricades prevented any worker from unintentionally approaching the active manifold. Supervisor escalated quickly and activated the missing ‑ person protocol. Chemical isolation valves remained locked, preventing accidental drain ‑ down. Operator was found quickly due to coordinated search actions. Lessons to prevent re-occurrence Always maintain communications (radio or backup) during chemical ‑ handling preparation. Incorporate check ‑ in/check ‑ out steps into all multi ‑ stage isolation tasks. Improve visibility and layout around chemical manifolds to reduce congestion. Ensure workers know the location of required hardware before starting critical steps. Reinforce protocol that no one leaves the zone during pre ‑ break verification. Actions"

The activity required harness use, tie ‑ off to an approved anchor point, and controlled access via a single ladder. During the pre ‑ task briefing, both workers confirmed the fall ‑ arrest plan and inspected their equipment. Midway through the inspection, one worker left the platform to retrieve a missing torque wrench from a nearby tool cabinet but did not inform the spotter remaining at height. When the spotter finished the visual checks and performed a headcount before stepping down, the second worker could not be located. The spotter attempted radio contact but received no response. Concerned that the worker may have fallen through adjacent open grating or descended via an unapproved path, the spotter initiated the missing ‑ person protocol and halted all activity. The worker was found moments later at ground level searching for the tool. No fall occurred, but the loss of visibility triggered an elevated emergency response. What could have happened Worker could have fallen from the unguarded area while moving between platforms. Potential for slipping on dusty or uneven grated surfaces without a spotter present. Rescue team activation for a presumed fall, creating unnecessary risk exposure. Worker could have accessed a ladder without maintaining three ‑ point contact or proper tie ‑ off. Why did it happen – Root causes Fall ‑ protection plan lacked clear expectations around mandatory communication when leaving an elevated work zone. Pre ‑ task briefing did not emphasize continuous personnel accountability for work at height. Insufficient supervision of simultaneous tasks involving multiple movement paths. Causal factors Worker assumed a quick trip to the tool cabinet did not require notification. Radio volume was turned down due to earlier noise in the area. Tools were not fully prepared before accessing the elevated platform. Congestion near the platform base created visual blind spots. Ladder access point lacked signage indicating “Do not exit without notifying spotter.” What went well Spotter performed headcount before descending, catching the deviation early. Stop ‑ work authority was exercised immediately. Fall ‑ arrest systems were properly inspected and ready for use. Emergency response team was on standby and prepared to mobilize. Area barricades prevented unauthorized personnel from entering the elevated zone. Lessons to prevent re-occurrence Always notify team members before leaving any elevated work platform. Ensure full tool readiness before climbing. Maintain radio volume and test communications prior to starting work at height. Reinforce headcount and movement tracking during all elevated tasks.

The task required accessing instruments located near a guardrail segment that had been temporarily removed for unrelated structural work. This change was noted in the work log but was not highlighted during the morning briefing. While repositioning a portable calibrator, one technician stepped backward to gain a better viewing angle and unknowingly moved within less than one metre of the unprotected edge. The second technician noticed the position deviation and immediately called for a stop. Work halted, and the exposed edge was barricaded before calibration proceeded. No fall occurred, but the proximity to the open edge represented a high ‑ potential incident. What could have happened Technician could have stepped into the unprotected opening and fallen approximately three metres to the level below. Secondary impact with piping or structural members could have resulted in severe injury. Dropped tools could have struck workers passing beneath the platform. Emergency response activation and work stoppage across the area. Why did it happen – Root causes Change in platform configuration was not integrated into the official access ‑ control or work ‑ at ‑ height procedure. Pre ‑ task hazard assessment lacked verification of temporary modifications in the work zone. Communication gaps between structural maintenance and instrumentation teams. Causal factors Technician focused on instrument display and not on edge awareness. Poor lighting near the removed guardrail reduced depth perception. The portable calibrator cart limited maneuverability, encouraging backwards movement. Morning briefing emphasized technical steps but did not cover updated area hazards. What went well Partner intervention occurred immediately when the unsafe position was observed. Stop ‑ work authority was exercised without hesitation. PPE (lanyards and harnesses) was available, even though the area was not initially categorized as requiring tie ‑ off. Temporary barricades were deployed quickly once the hazard was recognized. Lessons to prevent re-occurrence Always reassess hazard controls whenever access conditions change, even if unrelated to the primary task. Verify guardrails, barriers, and protection systems as part of pre ‑ task walkdowns. Ensure cross ‑ team communication on temporary modifications in shared work areas. Incorporate edge ‑ awareness reminders into calibration and inspection tasks requiring frequent repositioning. Actions"

While returning to their desk with printed materials, the employee’s foot caught the cord, causing them to stumble forward and fall against an open filing cabinet drawer. The impact resulted in a minor bruise on the hip and a small cut on the hand from contact with the drawer edge. Nearby coworkers assisted the employee, and first aid staff treated the injury on site. The area was secured until the tripping hazard and open drawer were addressed. What could have happened A fall with greater force could have caused a sprained wrist, fracture, or head injury. A coworker could have tripped on the same cord, creating multiple injuries. The fall could have damaged electronic equipment or pulled the laptop from the desk. Contact with the sharp corner of the filing cabinet could have resulted in deeper lacerations. Why did it happen – Root causes Workspace layout not designed for temporary equipment use: Limited accessible outlets led employees to improvise power setups. Inadequate hazard identification for office tasks: The employee did not assess walking paths before setting up the laptop. Lack of clear housekeeping expectations in shared spaces: Open drawers and trailing cords were not treated as active hazards. Causal factors Time pressure to join a meeting reduced attention to housekeeping. The filing cabinet had been left open by another team member retrieving files.

The space had limited lighting and relied on a portable extension cord powering both a laptop and a space heater. While attempting to plug in an additional device, the employee noticed the cord felt warm but continued using it. During an afternoon call, the extension cord overheated and caused a small electrical flash near the outlet. Startled by the flash and smoke, the employee stepped backward, tripped over a storage box, and fell against a shelving unit. This resulted in a minor electrical burn to the hand and a shoulder injury from the fall. The employee called a family member for help and later sought medical attention. The incident was reported after the employee informed their supervisor about needing modified duties. What could have happened An electrical fire could have ignited nearby cardboard storage materials. Overheating could have caused a larger arc event, resulting in severe burns. The fall could have resulted in a head injury or fracture. Smoke inhalation could have occurred in the enclosed space. Why did it happen – Root causes Inadequate risk assessment for WFH environment: No review process to identify electrical load limits or workspace hazards. Use of unsuitable equipment: Non ‑ rated extension cord used for high ‑ demand electrical devices. Lack of organizational oversight: No formal guidance requiring safe electrical setup verification for remote environments. Causal factors Cluttered storage area used as a makeshift office. Poor lighting reducing visibility of damaged cord shielding. Competing home activities and distractions increasing task load. Time pressure and back ‑ to ‑ back meetings limiting awareness of discomfort or hazards. Lack of accessible grounded outlets in the workspace. What went well The employee evacuated the area immediately after the electrical flash. Medical treatment was sought promptly, reducing risk of complications. Supervisor responded quickly and arranged modified duties. No secondary fire or smoke spread occurred thanks to rapid unplugging and ventilation. Lessons to prevent re-occurrence WFH areas must undergo basic electrical safety checks, especially when heaters or high ‑ load devices are used. Extension cords should only be used temporarily and must be appropriately rated. Employees should avoid using storage rooms or cluttered areas as full ‑ time workspaces. Adequate lighting is essential for identifying electrical and trip hazards. Organizations should provide clear WFH electrical and ergonomic standards with self ‑ assessment tools. Actions"

Believing it to be legitimate, the employee clicked the link and downloaded a malicious file. Immediately after launching the program, the laptop froze and displayed an error message. Concerned about losing access during an upcoming meeting, the employee attempted to force a restart by unplugging both the laptop and a personal backup battery pack connected through an overloaded power strip under their desk. In doing so, the worker contacted a damaged plug that caused a brief electrical spark. Startled, the employee pulled back quickly, struck their forearm against the corner of the desk, and fell off the rolling chair. The phishing attack locked the laptop and triggered unauthorized access attempts on shared cloud folders. The fall resulted in bruising and a minor laceration requiring medical attention. The employee notified IT only after losing access entirely. What could have happened Electrical short could have ignited nearby papers or carpeting. Malware could have spread rapidly to shared drives, compromising confidential business data. A more severe fall could have resulted in a head or back injury. The compromised device could have been used to access sensitive customer or financial systems. Why did it happen – Root causes Insufficient verification controls for remote access: No mandatory URL or sender validation steps for remote employees. Lack of standardized home ‑ office setup requirements: Use of an overloaded, uninspected power strip. Gaps in remote ‑ work cyber ‑ awareness training: Employees not regularly retrained on phishing indicators or reporting pathways. Causal factors Time pressure to join a meeting increased risk ‑ taking behaviour. Home office clutter made electrical hazards difficult to spot. Multiple personal and work devices connected through the same extension bar. Employee attempted to troubleshoot alone instead of contacting IT support. Confusing, look ‑ alike email domains exploited user fatigue and limited vigilance. What went well Device’s security monitoring system automatically isolated the infected files, limiting data spread. Cloud access logs allowed IT to quickly block unauthorized attempts. The employee sought medical care promptly after the fall. Incident reporting triggered a broader review of remote ‑ work cybersecurity posture. Lessons to prevent re-occurrence Remote workers must verify software ‑ update prompts through official channels. WFH electrical setups must meet minimum safety specifications and avoid overloaded power strips. Employees should immediately report suspicious emails or unexpected device behavior. Cybersecurity and physical ‑ safety risks are interconnected in remote environments and require combined assessment. IT helpdesks must provide clear, rapid remote ‑ support pathways to discourage unsafe troubleshooting. Actions"

Cyber Intrusion Causes Unsafe Pressure Surge in Utility Line Category: Near Miss Risk Level: High Setting: Gas Distribution Header – Automated Pressure Control Date: 2024 Location: Canada Injury Category: No Injury Severity: Potentially Significant Primary Classification: Security What happened A process utility line supplying clean compressed gas to multiple production units was operating normally under automatic control. The pressure controller received feedback from a transmitter and modulated a control valve through a PLC. During a routine shift, operators observed the header pressure rising steadily, followed by a sudden spike that exceeded the normal operating envelope. Attempts to move the system into manual control were rejected by the interface. Field technicians confirmed the valve remained fully open despite operator commands to close. Investigation revealed that an unauthorized remote login had accessed the engineering workstation. A malicious script executed shortly after the login pushed a forced ‑ open command to the pressure valve, bypassing the controller’s internal limit logic. Operators closed upstream manual block valves and vented the header through a controlled relief line. The pressure gradually stabilized, and no equipment damage or injuries occurred. The compromised workstation was isolated and the PLC returned to normal configuration. What could have happened Overpressure causing rupture of distribution piping or instrument impulse lines. Release of gas into the work area, creating suffocation or displacement hazards. Activation of multiple relief devices leading to uncontrolled discharge. Extended unplanned shutdown of multiple units due to loss of stable supply pressure. Why did it happen — Root causes Cybersecurity controls for remote access to the engineering workstation were inadequate. Pressure control design relied heavily on software logic without sufficient hardwired interlocks. Risk assessments did not consider cyber ‑ initiated manipulation of control valves. Causal factors Operators assumed digital override alarms would trigger immediately but thresholds were too narrow. Critical workstation had outdated authentication and no multi ‑ factor protection. Control room staffing levels limited early detection of slow ‑ trend pressure anomalies. Segmentation between engineering and operations networks was insufficient. What went well Operators noticed the abnormal trend early and escalated quickly. Manual isolation and venting procedures were executed effectively. Relief capacity was available to handle partial surges. Cybersecurity team quarantined compromised systems promptly. Lessons to prevent re ‑ occurrence Cyber intrusions must be treated as credible initiators of physical overpressure events. Pressure ‑ critical systems require physical safety layers that cannot be overridden digitally. Forced commands to valves or actuators should generate immediate alarms and inhibit unsafe movement. Engineering workstations must follow strict access control, patching, and monitoring standards. Operators should verify physical valve response when digital commands behave unexpectedly. Actions"

Confidential Work Viewed by Bystander During Public Café Session Category: Near Miss Risk Level: Medium Setting: Remote Work – Public Café Date: 2021 Location: Vancouver Injury Category: No Injury Severity: Potentially Significant Primary Classification: Security What happened An employee conducting routine administrative work from a public café opened a work dashboard containing internal project data. The table layout was visible on a laptop facing outward toward foot traffic. A nearby customer briefly stood behind the employee while waiting for their order and appeared to glance at the screen. The employee noticed the reflection of the bystander in the window and immediately locked the laptop. No confirmed data capture occurred, and the employee relocated to a more private seating area. The incident was later reported as a potential visual ‑ exposure near miss. What could have happened Sensitive internal data could have been viewed, photographed, or recorded. Information could have been shared beyond the organization, creating reputational or competitive risk. Unauthorized access attempts could have been attempted using visible project names or system structures. A broader data ‑ privacy incident could have required formal investigation and notification. Why did it happen – Root causes Remote ‑ work model lacked clear guidance for public ‑ space device ‑ use risk. Inadequate physical ‑ privacy controls available in the employee’s mobile setup. Security awareness training did not emphasize shoulder ‑ surfing as a visual ‑ exposure hazard. Causal factors Crowded café seating and high customer turnover. Screen brightness left information easily readable from multiple angles. Time pressure to complete work between meetings led to reduced situational awareness. Assumption that working in a casual environment carried minimal data ‑ security risk. Lack of a privacy screen filter on the laptop. What went well Employee noticed the potential exposure and locked the device immediately. No confirmed data capture occurred, reducing the overall impact. Incident was proactively reported, allowing for learning and improvement. Employee moved to a lower ‑ risk environment before resuming work. Lessons to prevent re ‑ occurrence Treat public environments as high ‑ risk zones for visual data exposure. Always use privacy ‑ screen filters when mobile working. Ensure remote ‑ work guidelines clearly define acceptable and non ‑ acceptable locations for handling sensitive information. Build awareness that data protection includes physical observation risks, not just digital threats. Encourage employees to assess surroundings before opening any internal systems. Provide ergonomic setups or alternative spaces for mobile workers. Actions"
